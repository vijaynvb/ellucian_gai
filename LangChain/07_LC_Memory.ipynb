The main downside, however, is the cost. Each request is sending the aggregation to the API. Since the charge is based on token usages, the cost can quickly add up, especially if you are sending requests to an AI platform. Additionally, there can be added latency given the sheer size of the text that’s being passed back and forth."

It was named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world. The Eiffel Tower is 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall, including its antenna, and it was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the Chrysler Building in New York was completed in 1930. It attracts around 7 million visitors annually. The tower has three levels for the public, with the third level offering a beautiful view of Paris. The Eiffel Tower also has a restaurant on the first level, Le Jules Verne, and a restaurant on the second level, Le 58 Tour Eiffel. The tower is illuminated both day and night and is bathed in gold every year on Bastille Day, July 14th.
